we have a setValue function that takes an argument newValue. Let's go through the different statements used:

require() is used to validate a condition. If the condition is not met, it throws an exception and reverts the transaction. In the example, we require the newValue to be greater than zero.

assert() is used to check an assertion that should always be true. If the assertion fails, it indicates a bug in the contract logic, and the transaction is reverted. In the example, we assert that newValue is not equal to 42.

revert() is used to explicitly revert the transaction. It is typically used to provide a specific reason for the revert. In the example, if the newValue is 999, we explicitly revert the transaction with the message "Invalid value".
